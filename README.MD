# Pizza Shop
Desktop application for ordering pizzas built in Java programming language.
## Motivation
This project is an assignment for java course at my school, this was a good project to implement Decorator design pattern of which i have learnt in a Software Engineering course. 
## Built with

 - Java
 - JavaFX
 - Decorator design pattern
## Features
This application comes with a TCP server and a client. Server takes orders and displays delivered and undelivered orders in two tables. On the client side users can chose which pizza they want to order and their payment method, while leaving contact information.

## Conclusion
Using decorator design pattern made cost calculations for each combination of pizza types and topping really easy. One idea i got from this is that with good architecture and decorator design pattern one could make a universal back-end service for food ordering.
